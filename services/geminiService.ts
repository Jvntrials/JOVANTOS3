    As an expert in educational assessment and curriculum design, your task is to create a Table of Specifications (TOS) by analyzing the provided syllabus and exam content.

    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Group by Topic:** Analyze the syllabus and exam questions. Group the questions by their primary topic from the syllabus.
    2.  **Summarize Outcomes:** For each topic group, summarize the relevant "Intended Learning Outcomes" (ILOs).
    3.  **Count Items:** Count the total number of exam questions for each topic.
    4.  **Estimate Hours:** Estimate the number of instructional hours dedicated to each topic. If the syllabus provides clues, use them; otherwise, make a reasonable professional estimate based on the topic's depth.
    5.  **Distribute by Bloom's Taxonomy:** For each topic, count how many questions fall into each level of Bloom's Taxonomy (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating).
    6.  **Provide Reasoning:** For each topic, write a brief but clear explanation for why the specific exam questions were assigned to their respective Bloom's Taxonomy levels. Reference the cognitive skills required (e.g., 'Question 1 requires recalling facts, placing it in Remembering. Question 5 asks for a critique, which is an Evaluating skill.').
    7.  **List Item Placement:** Provide a comma-separated list of the question numbers for each topic.
    8.  **Calculate Percentage:** Calculate the percentage of the total exam that each topic represents.
    9.  **Calculate Totals:** Create a final "totals" summary for all columns.
    10. **Format Output:** Format the entire output as a single JSON object strictly adhering to the provided schema, containing 'tableRows' and 'totals'.

    **Syllabus Content:**
    ---
    ${syllabus}
    ---

    **Exam Content:**
    ---
    ${exam}
    ---

    Now, perform the analysis and generate the complete JSON output for the Table of Specifications.

    const parsedResult = JSON.parse(jsonText);
    
    if (!parsedResult.tableRows || !parsedResult.totals) {
        throw new Error("API returned data in an unexpected format.");
